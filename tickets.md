# REPLIT assignment

## Ticket 1
---

Thank you for contacting us at Replit support. Taking a look at the screenshot you have provided, I think your issue is that your ip variable is set to '127.0.0.1' when it should be set to '0.0.0.0'. This allows the program to be publically accessible.  Once we change that value and run the script, we see the webview pop up and show "hello from node.js server" as expected.

You can see this change in my example environment [here](https://replit.com/join/nyndglyqqp-adamelchert1)

If you should have any further questions, please let us know and we will be happy to help. 

## Ticket 2

User, 

Thank you for contacting us here at replit support. We do in fact locally cache packages for user environments. I see that the package you are looking for is also at version 1.34.1 in our cache as well. I am going to put in a ticket with our engineers to see if we can get that package updated for you. If this is possible, I will be sure to keep you updated as I hear back from the team. 

In the future, this cache is something we want to have updated automaticaly as new versions of packages are released. I am going to file a feature request with your use case for the team to review. If you have any additional comments, please feel free to let me know. 

In the meantime, please let me know if you have any further questions and I'll be happy to help. Thanks!
